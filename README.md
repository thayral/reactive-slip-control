# Learning-Based Slip Detection for Adaptive Grasp Control

Project page for my PhD work:
Learning-based slip detection for adaptive grasp control in robotic manipulation

- Multi-contact, adaptive grasp stabilization
- Event-triggered reaction to slip (no friction modeling)
- Learning-based tactile perception + interpretable force control
